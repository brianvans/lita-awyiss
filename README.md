# lita-awyiss

Aw yiss. Motha fucking lita plugin.

Uses the [awyisser.com](http://awyisser.com) API to create duck memes.

## Installation

Add lita-awyiss to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem "lita-awyiss"
```

## Usage

```
> awyiss your text here
```

Also accepts the form `awwyiss`, since HipChat has convinced the masses that it should have two w's.
